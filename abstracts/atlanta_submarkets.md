**A Comparison of Submarket Separation Techniques: A Case in the City of Atlanta** 

***Abstract***

Defining urban submarkets remains an active research question. Some scholars even declare the nonexistence of residential housing submarkets. Goodman and Thibodeau (1998) – G-T – marks a common reference point for discussion. G-T used geographic school districts in Dallas to designate submarkets, estimated by a hierarchic model to allow variation within submarkets.

School quality remains a popular hedonic amenity to sort housing markets. So, we replicate the G-T hierarchic method that used an intercept shifter for the Atlanta housing market; and we also employ an intercept/slope adjustor among middle school districts.

We add flexibility in another estimator to consider that true submarkets are likely multi-dimensional, aggregating across many hedonic characteristics to allow individual households to possess unique preference orderings across the housing stock, ranking houses from least to most preferred differently. We use a finite mixture to form a small set of submarkets (two to five). The estimator first mixes among household characteristics from census tract demographics as a finite mix.

Initially, we assign each residence as equally likely members of each submarket. We then iteratively update submarket membership via an E-M estimator while simultaneously fitting different parameter estimates for hedonic features until estimation convergence to assigned criteria. The result fits a unique distributed probability of membership across submarkets for every residence to generate a unique parameter estimate array, akin to random parameters yet across all explanatory variables. The method increases overall efficiency as it validates the G-T proposition of distinct, coherent submarkets without pre-imposing shared geographic boundaries.
