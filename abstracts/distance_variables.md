**A Problem with Distance Variables and Alternatives for their Use**

Researchers commonly use distance variables to (1) estimate the direct influence of a landmark on an outcome of interest, such as a neighborhood park on home price, or (2) control for omitted spatial influences that affect predictions of key policy variables. Though used, there remain concerns about the effects that distance variables might exert on multivariate analyses. While both uses continue, the use of distance as a control to capture omitted effects of location is more common. The variable used for this control purpose most frequently is distance to the Central Business District (CBD). The variable is added to a multivariate analysis to capture larger and unmodelled spatial effects due to the position of an observed action, which may influence an outcome under study.

What is needed is a much more simplified picture of the effects of distances variables: what they measure and what they donâ€™t measure; and how all of this affects the types of questions common in the regional sciences. This work (1) shows that there is a latent and inherent identification problem with the distance variable; and, as a result, even the use of distance as a control is affected. These potentially high biases effects more than the distance variable but generate inconsistent effects estimates for all spatially distributed variables in a model, including policy variables. There still remains a need to add some control for position of observed actions in a model. So, this work (2) introduces an alternative to the CBD distance to control truly for the influences from overall position due to other omitted influences in a model.
