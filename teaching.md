At Texas Tech, I teach the undergraduate Agricultural Statistics (*Introduction to Statistics*) and conduct lab classes. This is a required course for all degree programs in the Agricultural & Applied Economics Department and a core course in the curriculum in Davis College. I also serve as a teaching assistant for graduate courses in Advanced Natural Resource Economics and Agribusiness Finance.
