I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Auburn University. 

My current research focuses on agricultural, rural, and spatial economics, with an emphasis on how data-driven insights can strengthen the vitality and resilience of small farms. I use high-resolution geospatial data, restricted-access Census of Agriculture and Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) microdata, and advanced econometric and spatial modeling techniques to study land access, productivity, technology adoption, and the structural challenges facing beginning and young farmers. Much of my current work identifies the regional, market, and policy conditions that allow small farms to enter, survive, and grow. 

My work has so far appeared in *[Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-agricultural-and-applied-economics/article/economic-opportunities-of-bioelectricity-from-cotton-gin-waste/02BA814A3A7FAB86FB9E364DAE653489)*, *[Food Policy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919223000155?via%3Dihub)*, *[Agriculture & Food Security](https://agricultureandfoodsecurity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40066-023-00447-z)*, *[Agrekon](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03031853.2024.2368128)*, *[Journal of Real Estate Research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03031853.2024.2368128)*. I also have papers under review that study the spillover effects arising from the geographic distribution of new farmer entrants, beginning and women farmer efficiency, causal impact of precision agriculture technology, property tax discrimination, and discontiguous submarket dilineation techniques.

I have [teaching](/teaching/) experience in statistics/econometrics and have TA-ed in Ph.D. quantitative methodology in natural resource economics and undergraduate finance courses. 


<!--- My research output and approaches do not fit into a single category. While focused on centralized themes, I attempt to bridge several fields and methodologies. My empirical style is more like that of an applied economist using rigorous empirical approaches to answer questions that enjoy currency. In general, my research involves rigorous modeling coupled with complex, high-resolution data providing a deep understanding of individual behavior. --->
