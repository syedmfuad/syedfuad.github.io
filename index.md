I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics at Texas Tech University. 

My research centers on agricultural and geospatial economics. I leverage high-resolution data and advanced econometric methods to address challenges in managing localized resources. Currently, I am using restricted-access Census of Agriculture data to identify niche markets and industries that attract small and medium-sized beginning farmers. 

My published work so far has explored areas of spillover effect of conflict (*[Food Policy'23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919223000155?via%3Dihub)*), causal effects of conflict (*[Agriculture & Food Security'23](https://agricultureandfoodsecurity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40066-023-00447-z)*), resilience in the face of conflict (*[Agrekon'24](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03031853.2024.2368128)*), and problems with using distance variables in hedonics (*[Journal of Real Estate Research'24](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03031853.2024.2368128)*). I also have papers under review that study property tax discrimination, and economic feasibility of converting cotton gin to electric power.

I have [teaching](/teaching/) experience in statistics and have TA-ed in Ph.D. quantitative methodology in natural resource economics and undergraduate finance courses. 


<!--- My research output and approaches do not fit into a single category. While focused on centralized themes, I attempt to bridge several fields and methodologies. My empirical style is more like that of an applied economist using rigorous empirical approaches to answer questions that enjoy currency. In general, my research involves rigorous modeling coupled with complex, high-resolution data providing a deep understanding of individual behavior. --->
