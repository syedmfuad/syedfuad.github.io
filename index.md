I am currently a graduate instructor and Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Applied Economics at Texas Tech University. Before that, I completed my undergrad majoring in Finance and Mathematics. 

My research agenda is broadly focused on developing programmable computational models to tackle challenges that arise from real-world data. I leverage large, high resolution data sources - household surveys, home sales, mobile phone GPS, remote sensing, geospatial gridded production - to capture and improve understanding of human networks and resource use behavior to inform resource policy. 

As an applied microeconomist, my research strengthens the data-policy pathway by using applied econometric and machine learning methods, first by collecting unique, high-resolution data, and then by applying advanced techniques that often require high quality, high-resolution data. 

My academic work has been published in *Food Policy* and *Agriculture & Food Security*. Publications, current projects, including working papers, can be found [here](/research/). Requests for drafts of complete working papers are welcome. Please email me to request a draft. A copy of my CV can be found [here](/FuadSyed_CV_04152023.pdf). 

I have [teaching](/teaching/) experience in statistics and have TA-ed in graduate-level quantitative methodology and undergraduate-level finance courses.
