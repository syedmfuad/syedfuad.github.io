Welcome to my website. I am a graduate instructor and Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Applied Economics at Texas Tech University. Before that, I earned my B.S. in Finance and Mathematics.

My research agenda is broadly focused on developing programmable stochastic models of resource use behavior to inform resource policy via high-resolution data. As an applied microeconomist, my research strengthens the data-policy pathway by using applied econometric and machine learning methods, first by collecting unique, high-resolution data, and then by applying advanced techniques that often require high quality, high-resolution data.

My academic work has been published in Food Policy.

I have teaching experience in statistics and have TA-ed in graduate-level quantitative methodology and undergraduate-level finance.
