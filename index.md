I am currently a graduate instructor and Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Applied Economics at Texas Tech University. Before that, I completed my undergrad majoring in Finance and Mathematics. 

My research develops programmable computational models to tackle challenges that arise from real-world data. I leverage **large, high resolution data sources** - household surveys, home sales, mobile phone, remote sensing, geospatial gridded production - to capture and improve understanding of **human networks and resource use behavior**. 

As an applied microeconomist, my research strengthens the data-policy pathway by using applied econometric and machine learning methods, first by collecting unique, high-resolution data, and then by applying advanced techniques that often require high quality, high-resolution data. My work so far has explored areas of spillover ([Food Policy'23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919223000155?via%3Dihub)) and causal (Agriculture & Food Security, forthcoming) effects of conflict, small-world network structure and research productivity ([AAEA'23, SEA'23, AEA'24](/PPT_Strength%20of%20weak%20ties.pdf)), property taxation discrimination ([MCRSA'23, SEA'23, AEA'24](/PPT_Bias%20in%20Atlanta%20property%20tax.pdf)), housing submarkets ([MCRSA'23](/PPT_Submarket%20separation%20in%20Atlanta.pdf)), and socio-economic and locational determinants of food stores ([AAEA'23, AEA'23](/Poster_Determinants%20of%20food%20retailer%20location.pdf)). To address these issues, I have employed research methods ranging from causal machine learning ([AAEA'23, AEA'23](/PPT_Comparative%20effectiveness%20of%20causal%20ML.pdf)), [network modeling](/PPT_Strength%20of%20weak%20ties.pdf) to [optimization](/PPT_Bioenergy.pdf). 

Publications, current projects, including working papers, can be found [here](/research/). A copy of my CV can be found [here](/FuadSyed_CV_04152023.pdf). 

I have [teaching](/teaching/) experience in statistics and have TA-ed in graduate-level quantitative methodology and undergraduate-level finance courses.
