As an applied microeconomist, my work involves developing programmable computational models that employ very high-resolution and spatiotemporal data. The emphasis on high-resolution data coupled with complex, emerging methodologies to manage very local and specific resources in a very targeted way is a common theme of my research. Broadly, my two most competitive skills are the ability to locate very quickly, very high-resolution data that then demand advanced numerical methods to answer nuanced policy questions that enjoy immediate currency in public discourse. 

My research interest broadly centers on computational social sciences and natural resources. I am interested in works that require advanced analytical tools and methods to address these topics, both in a cross-section and intertemporal context. I also enjoy collaborating with interdisciplinary teams and have experience working with remote sensing data, gridded agricultural production data, geospatial analysis, causal inference and machine learning in addition to regular econometric analysis, modeling and visualization. 

Requests for drafts of working papers are welcome. Please feel free to email me your request. 

### Dissertation <br>
My dissertation is organized around three themes. The first examines specific properties of social networks to locate opportunities to fund academic researchers strategically in order to facilitate research productivity and network connectedness. I developed an integrated econometric modeling and simulation method to examine the productive collaborations of researchers to predict publication output. Using collaboration as the unit of analysis, the analyses determine the expected number of publications, the likelihood that new researchers enter the network through a collaboration, or if an existing researcher will exit. I compare several funding strategies and assess whether network compactness or density contributes to overall topic advancement, in particular, if the most successful strategies exhibit the properties of a small-world network. <br>

The second dissertation paper centers on improving output of a biopower process. I was able to locate hourly data on electricity prices at gins for 12 years and develop a stochastic distribution of electricity prices month by month using Bayesian simulation methods. I conduct operations research to allocate variable gin trash volumes to jointly manage ginning and biopower together over a 9-month ginning season over 10,000 simulation years at different scales of power generation. <br>

The final paper examines the extent to which a persistent, racial property taxation gap exists in Atlanta, GA, even after city leadership shifted to minority control. I use high-resolution demographic and sales price data, downscaling geospatial mapping to appropriate scales, to locate neighborhood characteristics of a sale, as well as individual housing characteristics and those of adjacent neighbors. All of these had to be conformed to a uniform scale to provide highly detailed individual outcomes. This reversed a prior finding using much less detailed information that African Americans were under-taxed in Atlanta. <br>
